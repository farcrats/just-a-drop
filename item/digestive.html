            <h3>TerraGreens Product Description</h3>
            <p>One of the most universal nutritional issues is that people simply do not eat enough fruits and
                vegetables. According to the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention, less than 1 out of every 3
                adults eats the recommended amount of fruit per day and over 70 percent do not meet guidelines for
                vegetable consumption. Whether it is the time, taste, or cost involved in including the necessary fruits
                and vegetables in their diet, the majority of people simply do not eat enough fruits and vegetables for
                optimal health. With TerraGreens, doTERRA has put together a powdered greens mix that dismisses any
                excuse for not increasing your daily intake of fruits and vegetables. Naturally flavored with CPTG
                Certified Pure Therapeutic Grade® essential oils, TerraGreens provides a natural, GMO- and gluten-free,
                and vegan friendly boost of essential nutrients to support overall well-being.</p>
