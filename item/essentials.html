            <h3>Essential Oil Application</h3>

            <p>You will soon learn that there are hundreds of ways to use dōTERRA® essential oils, including relaxation,
                personal hygiene, household cleaning, cooking, and more. Every oil has at least one of three application
                methods: Aromatic , Topical , or Internal . Throughout this guide, you will fnd that each oil is labeled
                with one or more of these three methods using the letters A, T, and I. Here is a simple reference guide
                to help you safely and eﬀectively use the oils in your kit.</p>

            <p><span class="subjectFirstLetter">A</span><span class="subject">romatic:</span> The essential oil can be
                diﬀused or inhaled directly for a stimulating aromatic experience. Using oils
                aromatically can help improve mood and purify the air of unwanted odors.</p>

            <p><span class="subjectFirstLetter">T</span><span class="subject">opical:</span> The essential oil is easily
                absorbed by the skin and can be safely applied topically by itself, with other
                topical oils, or with carrier oils.</p>

            <p><span class="subjectFirstLetter">I</span><span class="subject">nternal:</span> The essential oil can also
                be used internally to support a variety of health benefits. These internal oils
                can be used as dietary supplements by placing them inside a veggie capsule or adding them to drinks</p>
