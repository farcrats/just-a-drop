            </header>
            <p>Many parents are now in the thick of getting their children into the routine of school and homework. But,
                regardless of where you live or when your children start school, the approaching changing of seasons
                also brings the higher potential of environmental and seasonal threats. Keep your kids, and even your
                entire family on track with doTERRA’s specialized supplements for children.<br><br>Of the below
                supplements, doTERRA a2z Chewable™ and IQ Mega<sup>®</sup> were specifically formulated to work in
                concert with each other. A more recent addition, PB Assist<sup>®</sup> Jr., is also a great source of
                nutrients necessary in your child’s diet. Read on to find out more about each
                supplement.</p>
            <h3>doTERRA a2z Chewable</h3>
            <p>This supplement is a great base
                supplement for wellness because it addresses the cellular level. Toxic byproducts called free radicals
                can damage living cells and tissues in a process called oxidative stress. Cells can then defend
                themselves against damage by using molecules called antioxidants found in doTERRA a2z Chewable, like
                vitamins A, C, and E.* In addition to providing the external antioxidant protection against free-radical
                damage, the polyphenols in doTERRA a2z Chewable also support the internal production and recycling of
                antioxidants made by the body.*<br><br>Available in a watermelon flavor that kids love, the doTERRA a2z
                Chewable tablets make getting those necessary vitamins and minerals into their diets easy. These
                nutrients and antioxidants support healthy cell development and longevity.*<br><br>Recommended dose:
                Children four years old and older should take two tablets daily with meals, adults may take up to three
                tablets daily.</p>
            <h3>PB Assist Jr.</h3>
            <p>PB Assist Jr., with its five billion
                live cells from 6 strains of friendly bacteria and prebiotics, has become a fast favorite at doTERRA.
                Not only does the strawberry watermelon flavor taste delicious, it promotes healthy microflora balance
                and by doing so supports the immune system along with the gastrointestinal system.<br><br>So much of our
                health is involved in our guts, making it even more important to populate the gut with good bacteria as
                early in a child’s developmental years as possible. Probiotic colonies start to develop during the birth
                process, and continue to develop with the consumption of breast milk. Through these natural processes,
                and then by adding even more probiotics through supplementation, children can promote optimal microflora
                balance, long-term digestive and immune system health, and general overall well-being.*<br><br>Recommended
                dose: Consume one sachet daily. You can take it by itself, or in cold foods such as yogurt, smoothies,
                or breakfast cereal.</p>
            <h3>IQ Mega</h3>
            <p>doTERRA created IQ Mega for both children
                and adults alike. Looking at the primary benefits list, IQ Mega contains quite a few benefits, from
                supporting joint health, to assisting the brain, and promoting cardiovascular health and a healthy
                immune system.<br><br>According to modern science, we should consume a 1:1 ratio of omega-6 to omega-3
                essential fatty acids. But, at least in the western diet, people are consuming far more omega-6 than
                omega-3. While we do need some omega-6 fatty acids as essential nutrients, this imbalance has been
                linked to major health problems. Simply increasing our intake of omega-3 fatty acids can positively
                impact our bodies, which is why IQ Mega has such great benefits.<br><br>Recommended dose: 1 teaspoon</p>
