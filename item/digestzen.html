            <p>You may have noticed that doTERRA has an abundance of supplements all intended to benefit the digestive
                system. If you’ve ever wondered why, the answer becomes clear when you look at statistics. Digestive
                health is a prime concern for many people—according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive
                and Kidney Diseases (NIH), approximately 60 to 70 million people are affected by digestive issues in the
                US alone. The supplements doTERRA offers were created to keep the various components of the digestive
                system functioning at their best.</p>
            <h3>DigestZen<sup>®</sup> Softgels</h3>
            <p>When you want to simply take the DigestZen blend to ease queasiness or soothe stomach discomfort after
                trying new foods, the softgels are a great option because you don’t have to fill your own veggie
                capsule. At two drops per capsule, you can take one softgel as needed.</p>

            <p class="withList"><span class="subject">Suggested Use:</span></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Take after enjoying a meal to promote digestion.</li>
                <li>When traveling or trying new foods take to soothe occasional stomach discomfort.</li>
                <li>Take with water or tea to maintain a healthy gastrointestinal tract.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>DigestTab<sup>®</sup></h3>
            <p>This chewable tablet is specifically designed for individuals with sensitive stomachs. Formulated with
                calcium carbonate, DigestTab works to neutralize and reduce acid. Ginger, Peppermint, Caraway,
                Coriander, Anise, Tarragon, and Fennel essential oils soothe and support the digestive system, and
                complete the list of ingredients.</p>
            <p class="withList"><span class="subject">Suggested Use:</span></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use as needed for relief from occasional upset stomach and heartburn.</li>
                <li>Take one tablet to provide relief from the occasional acid indigestion and can help reduce unwanted
                    belching and bloating.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>DigestZen TerraZyme<sup>®</sup></h3>
            <p>Metabolic enzymes are produced by your body and taken from the food you eat. Your body needs plenty of
                digestive enzymes to digest food and to help cells convert nutrients into energy. However, the
                processed, cooked, and preservative-laden foods in the modern diet are often enzyme deficient. TerraZyme
                contains a blend of active whole-food enzymes and supporting cofactors to make up the difference.</p>
            <p class="withList"><span class="subject">Suggested Use:</span></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Take one to three capsules with meals. Adjust the amount depending on what you’re eating—if you’re
                    eating plenty of fruits and vegetables, take one. If you’re eating something more highly processed,
                    take three.
