            </header>

            <p>Our skin is the largest organ of our body. It functions to guard the underlying muscles, bones, and
                internal organs. It is also our first line of defense from environmental factors, including dehydration,
                infection, and disease. It also serves to insulate us, regulate our temperature, convey the sense of
                touch and help with the production of vitamin D. Taking care of your skin is one of the best investments
                someone can do to live a long and happy life. There are a few important steps to taking care of our skin
                on a daily basis: cleansing, moisturizing, and protecting from the sun.</p>
            <h3>Cleansing</h3>
            <p>Cleansing the skin is an important step and does not have to be complicated. I recommend cleansing the
                skin twice daily. In general, it is beneficial to avoid strongly fragranced cleansers or ones with
                alcohol. It is also wise to avoid washing with hot water, as this can strip the natural oils from the
                skin.</p>
            <h3>Moisturizing</h3>
            <p>Moisturizing the skin is by far one of the best things you can do to preserve the elasticity of the skin
                and keep the barrier of the skin intact to allow the skin its ability to protect you. You may think you
                are too young to need moisturizer or that your skin is too oily, but all skin needs moisture. Even
                blemish-prone skin can benefit from moisturizing, as recently it has been found that blemishes may be
                due in part to skin barrier dysfunction that can lead to both inflammation and infection. It is
                important to note that moisturizers for patients with blemishes should be non-comedogenic (do not clog
                pores).</p>
            <h3>Protecting from the Sun</h3>
            <p>By far the most important element in decreasing damage to the skin that can lead to aging and skin cancer
                is sun protection. There are two main types of sunscreen: chemical (which absorbs the UV radiation) and
                physical (also known as mineral, which reflects the UV radiation). I highly recommend physical barriers,
                as these do not allow the sun to penetrate any of the skin barrier. It is important to wear sunscreen
                daily, even if just driving in the car, as UVA can penetrate the windows and cause long-term damage.</p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Overall, there are many different types of skin. The most common categories are dry skin, combination skin, oily skin, and then whether the skin is sensitive (easily irritated by topical product application) or not. When putting together a personal regimen for my patients, I always take these factors into consideration. For any specific questions or recommendations, I would advise speaking directly to your dermatologist or primary care physician.</p>
