            <h3>Root to Tip Serum Product Description</h3>
            <p>Natural CPTG Certified Pure Therapeutic Grade® essential oils can help maintain soft hair and a
                healthy-looking scalp. Complete with nourishing essential oils like Cedarwood, Lavender, Peppermint,
                Marjoram, and more, the doTERRA Salon Essentials Root to Tip Serum formula is designed to provide the
                hair with hydration and protection, without weighing hair down like other products do. The use of pure
                essential oils allows the Root to Tip Serum to gently nourish and rejuvenate the scalp while providing
                hair strands with proper moisture. This formula provides salon-level hair care without leaving behind a
                greasy residue—giving hair a light, healthy glow.</p>
            <h3>Protecting Shampoo Product Description</h3>
            <p>Essential oils are natural, gentle, safe, and good for the body—so why not use essential oils for hair
                and further extend the benefits of these natural compounds? The doTERRA Salon Essentials line is full of
                purifying, soothing products designed to maintain soft, smooth, healthy-looking hair. Among those
                products, the doTERRA Salon Essentials Protecting Shampoo brings the power of essential oils, natural
                cleansers, and botanicals straight to each strand of hair—helping to promote healthy, beautiful
                tresses.</p>
            <h3>doTERRA Salon Essentials Healthy Hold Glaze Product Description</h3>
            <p>While hairstyling products are designed to enhance the appearance of hair, they can often be tough on the
                scalp, leave behind a heavy residue, or even expose the hair to harmful chemicals. The doTERRA Salon
                Essentials Healthy Hold Glaze uses CPTG® essential oils to protect, enrich, moisturize, and soften the
                hair, no matter the length, color, or style. In addition to safe, natural ingredients, the Healthy Hold
                Glaze provides hair with a light, flexible hold, rather than weighing you down with a thick, oily
                residue. For beautifully styled hair, take advantage of the delightful aroma and gentle application of
                the doTERRA Salon Essentials Healthy Hold Glaze.</p>
            <h3>Smoothing Conditioner Product Description</h3>
            <p>Designed to create luminous, healthy-looking hair, the doTERRA Salon Essentials Smoothing Conditioner
                uses some of the finest natural ingredients and best essential oils for hair to reduce visible signs of
                damage, prevent static, and smooth strands. A must-have product from the doTERRA Salon Essentials line,
                the Smoothing Conditioner will take any hairstyle to the next level with smoothing, moisturizing
                ingredients that are soft on hair.</p>
