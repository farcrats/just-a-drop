            <h3>Peppermint Oil</h3>

            <p>The peppermint plant is a versatile perennial herb that has been cherished since ancient times. The
                plant’s first recorded appearance dates back to 1000 BC when dried peppermint leaves were found entombed
                in ancient Egyptian pyramids.1 Throughout time, this herb has been valued as a multi-purpose plant and
                an essential oil whose components are now used by cosmetic, culinary, and health industries around the
                world. Peppermint oil is also well known for its ability to help alleviate occasional stomach upset and
                promote healthy respiratory function when used internally.* With so many facets and uses, Peppermint
                essential oil continues to be one of doTERRA’s best-selling and highly-favored essential oils.</p>

            <h3 class="withList">Uses and Benefits</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Looking for something strong and natural to freshen your breath with? Mix a drop of Peppermint oil
                    with a drop of Lemon essential oil in water, take a sip, and swirl it around in your mouth for a
                    healthy, refreshing mouth rinse. One of the key ingredients to this mouth rinse is the menthol found
                    in Peppermint. Menthol has been used for centuries for its ability to cleanse and freshen. When you
                    use a drop of Peppermint oil in your mouth rinse, the menthol is what gives it a fresh and minty
                    kick. This powerful and fresh element is why Peppermint is found in many oral health products today.
                    When using this Peppermint mouth rinse, you will experience a pleasurable, cooling feeling your
                    mouth will love and you will walk away confident, knowing that your breath smells just as good as it
                    feels.
                </li>

                <li>Peppermint oil is a culinary wonder and has been used to add a fresh boost to meals in kitchens all
                    across the world. However, Peppermint is not just limited to cooked dishes; it also makes a great
                    addition to any drink or smoothie. Try adding one to two drops of Peppermint essential oil to your
                    favorite smoothie recipe for a refreshing twist. By adding the flavor of Peppermint oil to your
                    morning smoothie, you can start your day feeling more refreshed than ever.
                </li>

                <li>Don’t forget to get creative with your water, too! Add one drop of Peppermint with a cut fruit for a
                    deliciously infused water. Peppermint oil makes a healthy addition to any drink because it helps
                    promote healthy respiratory function and clear breathing, and by adding doTERRA Peppermint oil to
                    the drink of your choice, you are encouraging healthy respiratory function in your body* while
                    simultaneously adding a delicious flavor to your drinks.
                </li>

                <li>Peppermint can be used aromatically to enliven the senses and promote a feeling of energy. This
                    powerful oil can be extremely beneficial on its own, but when you add the right combination of
                    essential oils to Peppermint, you get a wider variety of beneficial results. Try placing one drop of
                    Peppermint oil in the palm of your hand, add one drop of Wild Orange essential oil and one drop of
                    Frankincense essential oil, and inhale. This simple aromatic recipe is perfect for a mid-day
                    pick-me-up.
                </li>

                <li>Including Wild Orange and Frankincense in this Peppermint mixture adds to its aromatic benefits.
                    Wild Orange carries a sweet and fresh citrus smell that is used to uplift the mind and body, while
                    Frankincense is valued for its ability to promote feelings of relaxation. By combining these two
                    essential oils with Peppermint’s soothing properties, the blend becomes an aromatic powerhouse that
                    will have you feeling relaxed and energized for the tasks ahead.
                </li>

                <li>Sometimes feet just get dried out. It happens, but that doesn’t mean you have to live with it. Try
                    this do-it-yourself Whipped Peppermint Foot Lotion and show your feet how much you appreciate them.
                    This is a simple and light lotion that includes natural ingredients like Peppermint and Melaleuca
                    (Tea Tree) essential oils. After a long day, there are few things better than taking a seat and
                    giving your feet the cooling sensation that this DIY lotion brings. For best results, try applying
                    this lotion generously to your feet and then putting socks on before you go to bed. Whipped
                    Peppermint Foot Lotion will not only leave your feet smelling fresh, it will transform your
                    sandpaper heels into a silky dream.

                <li>If you are looking for a way to share the benefits of Peppermint oil with your friends, try making
                    and sharing this DIY Candy Cane Sugar Scrub. This festive sugar scrub helps exfoliate and moisturize
                    the hands, feet, and body, and it makes for a great seasonal gift. Not only will the scrub produce
                    soft and smooth results, but its Peppermint oil base will provide a soothing sensation wherever it
                    is applied.
                </li>

                <li>Being outside in the sun can be a great way to uplift your mood, but sometimes too much sun exposure
                    can quickly end your fun. Try this homemade After Sun Soothing Spray to maintain healthy-looking
                    skin after too much sun. This soothing spray is filled with three powerful essential oils that calm
                    and soothe irritated skin. One of the primary oils used in this spray is Peppermint. Peppermint is a
                    perfect after-sun essential oil due to its high content of Menthol. Menthol is an organic substance
                    in peppermint plants that will give your skin that cool and soothing feeling it needs after a hot
                    day outdoors. Melaleuca (Tea Tree) essential oil and Lavender essential oil are two additional
                    ingredients in this DIY that will improve the appearance of skin.
                </li>

                <li>Looking for a long-lasting way to smell the sweet and minty aroma of Peppermint oil? Use this simple
                    yet invigorating diffuser blend and enjoy this fresh aroma in your home, office, classroom, gym, or
                    wherever you choose to go. To make this blend, combine 2 drops of Peppermint, 3 drops of Grapefruit,
                    and 2 drops of Sandalwood into a diffuser. Using Peppermint essential oil in your diffuser will
                    produce a cooling, invigorating vapor. Additionally, the grounding and mood-enhancing properties of
                    Sandalwood and the uplifting benefits of Grapefruit will work well with the soothing and relaxing
                    effects of Peppermint to produce an energizing and calming aroma that all will enjoy.
                </li>

                <li>Peppermint oil makes a great addition to many dishes, especially treats. Try using this Black Bean
                    Brownie recipe with Peppermint oil and put a nutritious and delicious spin on the traditional
                    chocolate brownie. At first, making a sweet treat with black beans may seem a little off-putting,
                    but don’t worry, black beans have a very mild flavor and are extremely rich, creamy, and full of
                    protein. Once you venture out with this recipe, you won’t want to go back. To create an extra pop of
                    flavor, add a couple drops of Peppermint essential oil for a delightful and refreshing flavor.
                </li>

                <li>The soothing components found in Peppermint essential oil make it a desirable oil for massages. Try
                    adding Peppermint to your massage experiences and enjoy the pleasurable cooling feelings it brings
                    to your skin while immersing yourself in its sweet and relaxing aroma. A great massage companion to
                    Peppermint is Lavender. This combination will produce optimal soothing feelings that will add to any
                    massage. You can also try adding Peppermint essential oil to your shampoo or conditioner for a
                    stimulating hair massage that will provide the pampering your scalp deserves.
                </li>

                <li>Looking for a way to repel bugs and spiders in your house? Luckily, Peppermint oil provides a
                    perfect solution to ward off those creepy crawlers. Many bugs and spiders dislike the potent smell
                    of Peppermint, consequently, Peppermint essential oil is used as a home remedy to repel bugs
                    naturally. Try placing 1–3 drops of essential oil on a cotton ball and position them in the corners
                    of your bathroom, bedroom, kitchen, laundry room, or wherever you think these unwanted guests might
                    be.
                </li>

                <li>If you or someone you know has trouble staying awake during long meetings or would like a natural
                    method to feel alert, Peppermint oil used topically and aromatically can help. Because of the
                    invigorating and cooling effects of pure Peppermint oil produces when it comes in contact with skin,
                    Peppermint is an ideal oil for staying attentive and aware. In order to create this extra boost,
                    place 1–2 drops of Peppermint on your finger tips and then place your fingertips on your temples and
                    rub. This will help give you the natural sense of alertness you desire when you need it most.
