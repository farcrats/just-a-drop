                <h2>About Just-A-Drop</h2>

                <h3>Just-A-Drop is your direct link to dōTERRA® essential oils.</h3>
            </header>

            <p>Founded in 2008, doTERRA was built on the mission of sharing therapeutic-grade essential oils with the
                world. Having seen for themselves the incredible benefits that can be had from using these precious
                resources, a group of health-care and business professionals set out to make this mission a reality.
                They formed a company and named it doTERRA, a Latin derivative meaning "Gift of the Earth."</p>

            <p>The first hurdle to overcome, however, was to establish a standard of quality in an industry that had
                never had one. It wasn't enough to simply provide essential oils to homes around the world; the doTERRA
                founders were committed to providing only the highest quality and purest essential oils so that families
                could know with surety that they were using only the best to promote health and wellness for their loved
                ones. This commitment lead to the creation of a new standard of therapeutic quality: CPTG Certified Pure
                Therapeutic Grade®.</p>

            <p>To achieve such a grand vision as bringing essential oils to the world required a team of dedicated
                people. This team would need to be made up of people dedicated to hard work, commitment, passion, and
                vision. That team has grown since its initial inception, but the mission remains the same—to provide
                essential oils that appeal to everyone from the novice to the expert, and that can be used safely on
                your loved ones.</p>
